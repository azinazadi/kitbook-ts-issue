# Kitbook Template

You're looking at the [Kitbook](https://kitbook.vercel.app/) template. You can click the **GitHub** icon in the upper right corner to view the code or view the [docs](https://kitbook.vercel.app/).

Note that this is the `index.md` file and is navigated to by clicking the title in the header of your Kitbook.

Here's a Foam extension generated auto-updating wiki-link to [[0-file-ordering]]. This works in GitHub, in VSCode, and in the browser to easily jump between markdown files.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[0-file-ordering]: docs/0-file-ordering.md "File Ordering"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
