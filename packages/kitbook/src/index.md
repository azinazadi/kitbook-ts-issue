# KitBook 

Documentation and Prototyping Workbench Tool for Svelte built with SvelteKit that lets you rapidly build, document, and test components. Most similar to [Svench](https://svench-docs.vercel.app/), but also with goodies inspired by [[9-why|others]].

## Features
- File-based sidebar tree structure, with optional prefixed numbers to adjust ordering of your docs
- Iframe isolation for easy media query testing
- Stories load via SSR first and then are hydrated on Client
- [MDSvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) (Markdown + Svelte Components) to enable easy documenation as you build
- Easy knobs allow for adjusting a component's state (special thanks to [@rixo](https://github.com/rixo)'s [Svench](https://svench-docs.vercel.app/))
- Quickly create and compare numerous variants of a component via an array of auto-typed prop objects in a colocated typescript file that can also be used for testing.
- All SvelteKit-only imports are automatically avaiable because it's a SvelteKit app. 
- Build components using the same initialization hooks as your main unless you turn them off i18n
- [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) based automatic updating wiki-links for easy linking within your Kitbook.
