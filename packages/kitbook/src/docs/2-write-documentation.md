# Write Documentation

You can create a folder with any name under your `/src` folder and begin writing documentation in markdown. This Kitbook has a `docs` folder, which is where this file exists as can be seen in the sidebar navigation. Since [[3-mdsvex]] to preprocess all `.md` and `.svx` files you can also include Svelte components in your markdown.

## Index Page

By default Kitbook will display your project's README.md file as its home page, but you can override this by using a `src/index.md` or `src/index.svx` file.

## Naming Conventions

Name files and folders according to how you want them shown in the sidebar. Alphabetically `Get Started` comes after `Button` but you can use an initial number followed by a hyphen to update the sort order as seen here:
- `1-get-started.md`, displayed first as `Get Started`
- `2-button.svelte`, displayed second as `Button`
  
Folder naming follows the same conventions. `0-components/` will show up as `Components` and be placed before `1-about/` (displayed as `About`).

## Convenient links

You know enough to get started but if you want to supercharge your documentation writing abilities, see [[6-easy-wikilinks]].
