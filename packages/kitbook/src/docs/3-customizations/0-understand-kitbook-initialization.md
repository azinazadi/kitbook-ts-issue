# Understand Kitbook's Initialization

When first running the `kitbook` plugin in your package, a folder will be copied into your `.kitbook` directory, as well as a configurable function to adjust your `svelte.config.js` file to use Kitbook's internal routing files, `app.html` and assets when running Vite in `kitbook` mode.

You'll also notice that since you're now running a 2nd SvelteKit app inside the same directory, SvelteKit's automatically generated files for your Kitbook app will be placed into `/.svelte-kit-kitbook` in order to not conflict with your main app's generated files in `/.svelte-kit`. So you can ignore the warning that shows upon running kitbook: `Your tsconfig.json should extend the configuration generated by SvelteKit...`.
