# Use Kitbook by Itself

If you are building a library and you want to use Kitbook by itself without a main app, you can do that. This is common when building a component library. First you should [[0-understand-kitbook-initialization]], then if you want to dig in further you could look in [Kitbook's source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/kitbook) you'll see the `routes` folder living inside of the `lib` directory (so it will be packaged up) or in [Svelte Pieces' source code](https://github.com/jacob-8/kitbook/tree/main/packages/svelte-pieces) you won't see a `src/routes` folder at all. When you are only building a library and not an app, then there is no main app to run Kitbook alongside and so your Kitbook becomes your main app. You could then just delete the `src/routes` folder.

## Styles Reset

If you are happy with the default Kitbook styles reset, you can go ahead and delete the standard SvelteKit `app.html` sitting in your repo because Kitbook provides its own. If you prefer to provide your own `app.html` with your own styles resets and such see [[2-app-html]].

## Filtering out stories and variants files from your package

If you are using `svelte-package` and you don't want to add your stories and variants files to the output package, you can add a `.npmignore` file to your repo and add the following to it:

```
*.variants.ts
**/*.md
*.svx
```
