# Get Started: How to Create a KitBook

**Warning: This is alpha software and not ready.** Watch the updating [[4-roadmap]] for clues on when that will be.

- Install the `kitbook` package: `npm i -D kitbook@alpha` or `pnpm add -D kitbook@alpha`

- Add the `kitbook()` Vite plugin *before* your `sveltekit()` plugin:
```js title="vite.config.js" {2,6}
import { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';
import { kitbook } from 'kitbook/plugins/vite';

const config = {
	plugins: [
		kitbook(),
		sveltekit(),
	],
};

export default config;
```

- Place your app inside of a [(group)](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts-group) folder named anything and add a `kitbook` folder to `src/routes`:
```txt {2,6}
src/routes/
│ (app)/
│ ├ dashboard/
│ ├ item/
│ └ +layout.svelte <-- initialize app only items, like db connections (refers to all layout files like +layout.ts)
│ kitbook/
└ +layout.svelte <-- initialize everything both your app and Kitbook need, like i18n 
```

- Run `npm kitbook` or `pnpm kitbook`
 
- Kitbook will automatically copy in its routing files to `src/routes/kitbook`. Please edit the settings found in `src/routes/kitbook/+layout.svelte` for your app, but don't touch the other files as they will be overridden in future updates as needed.

At this point you can open Kitbook and see all your Svelte components, *including `+page.svelte` and `+layout.svelte` files as they are also just plain Svelte components with a very important `data` prop*.
